# Lesson 13: Random
File for this lesson: <i>try_random.rb</i>
<br><br>
Random is a standard gem in Ruby and used to randomly generate integers or a float number. Use <b>rand</b> to generate a float number between 0 and 1. To generate an integer between a and b, use <b>rand(a..b)</b>, note that you should put a range betwen a and b, not a comma b. If you have an array, you may call a method on the array with <b>.sample</b> to randomly pick an element from the array, or use <b>.sample(n)</b> to pick n elements from the array.
