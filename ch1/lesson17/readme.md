math is a standard library to support any kind of mathematically expression, including squart root, natural log...etc. mathn is a newer version, but rely on math, to handle more flexible situations, like return an integer when square rooting an integer (It is not supported in math). Matrices is supported under mathn. To check whether a integer is a prime number, use the Prime gem, its instances contains the prime numbers. Use <b>prime?</b> to check whether the number is a prime number.

## File
The file requires <b>rational</b> and <b>mathn</b>. The file will print 2/3 and squart root of 2/3 and 25. Then, print natural log, multiplication of two matices, print prime number between 1 and 30, and find whether 37 is a prime number.
