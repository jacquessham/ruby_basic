# Ruby Basics
Repository to store the scripts when I learn Ruby. The goal is to learn the basic syntax in order to write scripts in Ruby to build productivity tools for sales engineers/data engineers and conduct analytical projects.

## Motivation
The major reason I learn Ruby because Ruby is one of the major programming language used in GoodData and majority of the cloud infrastructure components are written in Ruby; custom components integrated with the GoodData platform only allows Ruby scripts to plugin. As a data engineer in GoodData, I find it is important to learn to code in Ruby so that I can become more flexible to build any productivity tool which helps for my tasks or to improve the productivity of my collegues. Learning Ruby is one of my performance goals in the 1st half of 2021 in GoodData.

## Goals and Timeline
Below is the goals for myself to learn the programming language:
<ul>
	<li>By June, 2021: Complete Chapter 1-3</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

The learning is ongoing that the goals are subjected to add more or change.
