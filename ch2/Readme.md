The purpose of this chapter is to practice the basic syntax learnt from Chapter 1.

## Exercise 1: Supermarket Menu (Coming Soon...)
This exerice is to build a supermarket menu for user to interact on command line to select items and calculate the check out total in order to get used to the basic Ruby syntax. Click <a href="https://github.com/jacquessham/ruby_basic/tree/main/ch2/ex1_supermarket">here</a> for more detail.

## Exercise 2: Calculator (Coming Soon...)
The goal of this exercise is to practice declaring classes in Ruby. We are going to build a calculator for various purpose. Click <a href="https://github.com/jacquessham/ruby_basic/tree/main/ch2/ex2_calculator">here</a> for more detail.

## Exercise 3: Health Profile (Coming Soon...)
The goal of this exercise is to practice on defining classes, read and save files on Ruby. We will be simulate a health provider to calculate the simple health metrics for list of patients.

## Exercise 5: Craps (Coming Soon...)
The goal is to practice more loops and conditional by building a Craps simulator. Click <a href="https://github.com/jacquessham/ruby_basic/tree/main/ch2/ex5_craps">here</a> for more detail.

## Exercise 6: MyArray (Coming Soon...)
The goal of this exercise is to practice more on array, class, an loop by creating a class similiar to <i>ArrayList</i> in Java. Click <a href="https://github.com/jacquessham/ruby_basic/tree/main/ch2/ex6_myarray">here</a> for more detail.
