# Chapter 2: Exercies
The purpose of this chapter is to practice the basic syntax learnt from Chapter 1.

## Exercise 1: Supermarket Menu
This exerice is to build a supermarket menu for user to interact on the command line to select items and calculate the check out total in order to get used to the basic Ruby syntax. The goal is to get used to use basic methods in Ruby, such as loops, if-else statements, and import files.

## Exercise 2: Calculator
This exercise is to build a calculator which is able to calculate different formulas. The goal of this exercise is to practice declaring classes in Ruby. We are going to build a calculator for various purpose. Click <a href="https://github.com/jacquessham/ruby_basic/tree/main/ch2/ex2_calculator">here</a> for more detail.

## Exercise 3: Health Profile
This exercise is to build a program to read patients' basic health information and convert to health metric for reports. The goal of this exercise is to practice on defining classes, read and save files on Ruby. We will be simulate a health provider to calculate the simple health metrics for list of patients.

## Exercise 4: Guessing Game
The exercise is to build an interactive program for user to guess a number randomly pick from the program by having the user interact on the command line. The goal is to practice more loops and conditional by building a guessing game. Click <a href="https://github.com/jacquessham/ruby_basic/tree/main/ch2/ex4_guessing">here</a> for more detail.

## Exercise 5: Craps
This exercise is to build a program to simulate a crap game and show the result. The goal is to practice more loops and conditional by building a Craps simulator.Click <a href="https://github.com/jacquessham/ruby_basic/tree/main/ch2/ex5_craps">here</a> for more detail.

## Exercise 6: MyArray
This exercise is to build a class to store an array of integers and provide some basic math and statistics functionality. The goal of this exercise is to practice more on array, class, an loop by creating a class similiar to <i>ArrayList</i> in Java.
