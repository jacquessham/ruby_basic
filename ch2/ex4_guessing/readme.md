# Exercise 4: Guessing Game

The goal is to practice more loops and conditional by building a guessing game. This exercise is inspired from the homework Lab 3 of CS 112 from the University of San Francisco.

## Requirement
Write a class called <b>GuessingGame</b> that contains play() method to play a Guessing game with the user. The program should pick a integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), then repeatedly prompt the user to guess the number. After each guess, the program should print whether the user's guess is too high or too low. Your code should print "You got it!" once the user guesses correctly. The user should be able to end the game at any point by entering a 0. You should also keep track of the record of how many rounds it take the user to guess the number. Provide a empty file <i>(Coming Soon...)</i> with only headers, fill out the result for each game on that file for every game. See below section for detail and instructions of this file.
