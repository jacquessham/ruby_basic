# Exercise 5: Craps

The goal is to practice more loops and conditional by building a Craps simulator. This exercise is inspired from the homework Lab 3 of CS 112 from the University of San Francisco.

## Requirement
Build a class <b>Craps</b> with a <b>play</b> method. See below section for the game direction. Upload a text of a player's info, along with his chip balance. Record the gain or loss of each game, add the record of the game and update the player's balance.
