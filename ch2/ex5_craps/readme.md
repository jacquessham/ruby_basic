# Exercise 5: Craps

The goal is to practice more loops and conditional by building a Craps simulator. This exercise is inspired from the homework Lab 3 of CS 112 from the University of San Francisco.

## Requirement
Build a class <b>Craps</b> with a <b>play</b> method. See below section for the game direction. Upload a text of a player's info, along with his chip balance. Record the win or loss of each game, add the record of the game and update.
<br><br>
The Craps class requires 2 dice in the play method, build a class of <b>Die</b>, along with <b>roll</b> to randomly a number. In this exercise, build a fair die with 6 faces.

## Rules of Craps
Phase 1:<br>
First roll 2 dice. If the sum is 2, 3, 12, you lose; if the sum is 7 or 11, you win. Otherwise, you will receive the sum of 2 face value as game points and move on to Phase 2.
<br><br>
Phase 2:<br>
Continue to roll the dice until the sum of 2 dice to equal to 7 or the game points. If the sum is 7, the player loses; otherwise, the player wins.
